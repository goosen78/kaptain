UPGRADING FROM Kaptain 0.6
--------------------------

Since Kaptain 0.7 was completely rewritten, the syntax of grammars has
changed. To make your scripts work with Kaptain 0.7, check the
followings:
- All statements should end with a semicolon (;).
  This was only needed for rules in Kaptain 0.6, but now it is neccesary
  for descriptions and constraints, too.

- String constants and regular expressions should be closed on the
  line they are opened. To write multi-line strings, the only way is
  to use the <<DELIMITER ... DELIMITER form. (Perlish style multiline
  string.)
